# Moviebox
Created this for my raspberry pi. It makes use of the YIFY api and the transmission client api. Requires some configuration on the transmission client which I do not care enough for to descibe in detail. Basically a self made and self hosted Popcorn time.

## Uses
- My own framework (https://github.com/rubex01/framework)
- Transmission torrent client (api)
- YIFY api

# Goal
- Fast and simple interface for selecting a movie and watching it
- Locally hosted and full control over the code (transmission is also open source)
